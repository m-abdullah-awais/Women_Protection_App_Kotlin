        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        Welcome to SafeZone. By creating an account and using the SafeZone app ("the App"), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the App.<br/><br/>

        <h3>2. Purpose of the App</h3>
        SafeZone is designed to assist women in emergency situations by sending alerts and location data to trusted contacts and emergency services. It is a support tool and not a substitute for professional emergency services (e.g., 911/112).<br/><br/>

        <h3>3. User Accounts</h3>
        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree to provide accurate and current information during registration. SafeZone reserves the right to terminate accounts that provide false information or misuse the service.<br/><br/>

        <h3>4. Location Services</h3>
        The App requires access to your device\'s location to function correctly (e.g., sending SOS alerts). By using the App, you consent to the collection and sharing of your location data during emergencies.<br/><br/>

        <h3>5. Emergency Contacts</h3>
        You are solely responsible for managing your trusted contacts. SafeZone is not responsible if your contacts do not receive or respond to alerts due to network issues, incorrect numbers, or other factors beyond our control.<br/><br/>

        <h3>6. Prohibited Conduct</h3>
        You agree not to use the App for any unlawful purpose, including but not limited to:
        <br/>&#8226; Sending false SOS alerts
        <br/>&#8226; Harassing others
        <br/>&#8226; Attempting to compromise the App\'s security<br/><br/>

        <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        SafeZone is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the App, including failure of alerts to be delivered.<br/><br/>

        <h3>8. Changes to Terms</h3>
        We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Your continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of updated terms.<br/><br/>

        <h3>5. Data Security</h3>

        <h3>6. Your Rights</h3>
        You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. You can manage your profile settings within the App or contact support for assistance.<br/><br/>
